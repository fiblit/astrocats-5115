# Astrocats

We are the Astrocats, a group in CSCI 5115 at UMN-TC!

This is the repo for our PhoneGap app currently called "TakeCare".

# Instructions to Run

Make sure you have PhoneGap Desktop or PhoneGap CLI (I haven't tried that yet, though) first before
doing anything else. You can find them on the getting started page of PhoneGap [here]: 
http://phonegap.com/getstarted/

Then import the app by clikcing + > Open existing PhoneGap Project... > Browse file directory to
find "TakeCare" > Select that. Once you have imported it, run it and the platforms and plugins
**should** download automatically. You can test that everything is working by either going to 
http://localhost:3000 or the IP they provide you on the PhoneGap app on your mobile device.

Whatever you do though, DO NOT DELETE *config.xml*. DO NOT DELETE IT. That determines what needs to
be downloaded for all the project dependencies.

This page should also explain the general workings of the "hello-world" template:
